  <h1>The centerpoint for n lines</h1>
  <p>This tool allows you to draw lines by clicking twice on the screen, once for each point defining a line segment that will be extended until it intersects with a border </p>
  <p>Click this button to place the point <b>q</b>, the point that will be used to minimize <b>ÂµL(H)</b></p> <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_q)">Place Q</button>
  <p>Click this button to draw a line that will separate the plane in two halves. The half containing <b>q</b> will be called <b>H</b></p> <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_h)">Draw separator</button>
  <p>Click this button to find the best hline for the given qpoint</p> <button onclick="find_best_h()">Find best separator</button>
  <p>The following step is to implement an algorithm to find the best q. But to do that I need a reliable way to enumerate all the position of that point (other than trying points at random anywhere on the canvas). Also during my test, I didn't manage to find any point q such that the h line that minimize the number of green lines shows more than 0 green lines (Except for configurations with less than 4 lines but this is because I need to refine my implementation for finding the minimal set)</p>
